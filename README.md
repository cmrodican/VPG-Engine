## 🎯 Project Vision

VPG Engine aims to faithfully recreate the core gameplay experience of WWF No Mercy while being:

- **Completely free and open-source** (GNU GPL 3.0)
- **Built on modern web technology** (JavaScript/Web-based)
- **Legally clean** - zero copyrighted content
- **Highly customizable** - JSON-driven content with full modding support

### What We're Recreating

- **Grappling system** - The iconic position-based grappling mechanics
- **Strike priority** - Timing and counter-strike systems
- **Momentum (Attitude) meter** - The risk/reward special move system
- **Damage scaling** - Body part damage and move effectiveness
- **Reversal windows** - Frame-perfect timing and reversals
- **Ground game** - Submission, pin, and ground attack systems
- **Movement & physics** - Running, ropes, turnbuckles, and environmental interaction
- **Environmental accuracy** - Ring dimensions, collision points, and object behavior

## 🚧 Current Phase: Deep Documentation (Phase 1)

We are currently in the **research and documentation phase**. Our goal is to build a comprehensive knowledge base that will guide development.

### What We're Documenting

1. **Mechanics**: Every gameplay system broken down in detail
2. **Environmental Design**: Measurements, distances, collision points
3. **Data Structures**: JSON schemas for moves, characters, arenas, and more
4. **Observations**: Community research, frame data, and timing analysis

**No game code is being written yet.** This phase is about understanding and documenting the source material as accurately as possible.

## 🤝 How to Contribute

We need help from the community to document No Mercy's intricate systems! You can contribute by:

- **Playing and observing** No Mercy to document mechanics
- **Measuring** environmental elements (ring size, distances, etc.)
- **Analyzing** frame data, timing windows, and damage values
- **Writing documentation** in Markdown format
- **Creating JSON schemas** for structured data
- **Organizing** research materials and findings

**No programming experience required for Phase 1!** If you love No Mercy and want to help preserve its design, you can contribute.

## 🎮 Design Principles

### Accuracy First
We aim to recreate No Mercy's feel as faithfully as possible. When in doubt, we defer to how No Mercy actually works.

### No Copyrighted Content
This project will contain:
- ❌ No WWE/WWF characters, logos, or branding
- ❌ No licensed music or copyrighted assets
- ✅ Original characters, arenas, and assets
- ✅ Full customization through JSON and user-provided media

### Open and Moddable
Everything is designed to be:
- Human-readable (JSON, not binary formats)
- Easily customizable (characters, moves, arenas, belts)
- Community-driven (open contribution model)

## 🗺️ Roadmap

### Phase 1: Deep Documentation (Current)
Document all mechanics, environmental design, and create data schemas

### Phase 2: Engine Architecture
Design the technical architecture and core systems

### Phase 3: Prototype Development
Build working prototypes of key mechanics

### Phase 4: Full Implementation
Develop the complete game engine

### Phase 5: Content & Tools
Create content pipelines and modding tools
