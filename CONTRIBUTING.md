## üéØ Phase 1 Goals

We are currently in the **Deep Documentation phase**. The goal is to build a comprehensive knowledge base that will guide future development.

**You do not need programming experience to contribute!** If you're passionate about No Mercy and want to help document its systems, you can make a meaningful contribution.

---

## üìã How to Contribute

### 1. Choose a Documentation Area

Pick something you'd like to document:

#### Mechanics
- Grappling system (positions, tie-ups, move execution)
- Strike priority and counter-strike mechanics
- Momentum (Attitude) meter behavior
- Reversal windows and timing
- Damage scaling and body part targeting
- Ground game (submissions, pins, ground attacks)
- Movement physics (running, walking, rope physics)

#### Environmental
- Ring dimensions and measurements
- Collision detection points
- Rope behavior and physics
- Turnbuckle interactions
- Interactive objects (tables, ladders, chairs, etc.)
- Barricade and outside ring areas
- Arena layout standards

#### Systems
- Match types and rules
- AI behavior patterns
- Camera system and angles
- Audio cues and timing
- Special mechanics (crowd meter, etc.)

### 2. Research and Observe

Play No Mercy and carefully observe the system you're documenting:

- Take notes on behavior and timing
- Capture screenshots or video clips
- Test edge cases and interactions
- Measure distances and timing windows
- Document what you observe, even if incomplete

### 3. Create Documentation

#### For Markdown Documentation (`/docs/`)

Create a new `.md` file in the appropriate folder:

**Structure your documentation like this:**

```markdown
# [System Name]

## Overview
Brief description of what this system does and why it matters.

## Core Mechanics
Detailed explanation of how the system works.

## Observations
- Specific behaviors you've noticed
- Timing information
- Edge cases

## Open Questions
- Things that need more research
- Unclear behaviors
- Areas needing testing

## Related Systems
- Links to other documentation files
- How this interacts with other mechanics

## References
- Video timestamps
- Screenshot references
- Community findings
```

#### For JSON Schemas (`/data/schemas/`)

Create structured templates for data:

**Example Move Template:**
```json
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "title": "Move Template",
  "description": "Template for wrestling move data",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "id": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Unique move identifier"
    },
    "name": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Display name of the move"
    },
    "category": {
      "type": "string",
      "enum": ["grapple", "strike", "ground", "aerial", "special"]
    },
    "damage": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "head": {"type": "number"},
        "body": {"type": "number"},
        "arm": {"type": "number"},
        "leg": {"type": "number"}
      }
    },
    "execution_frames": {
      "type": "number",
      "description": "Number of frames to execute"
    },
    "reversal_window": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "start_frame": {"type": "number"},
        "end_frame": {"type": "number"}
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. Submit Your Contribution

#### Option A: GitHub Pull Request (Recommended)

1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Create a branch**: `git checkout -b docs/grappling-system`
3. **Make your changes**: Add or edit documentation files
4. **Commit**: `git commit -m "Add grappling system documentation"`
5. **Push**: `git push origin docs/grappling-system`
6. **Open a Pull Request** with a clear description of what you've documented

#### Option B: GitHub Issues

If you're not comfortable with Git:

1. Open a new Issue
2. Use the label `documentation`
3. Share your findings, notes, or research
4. Someone will help format it into proper documentation

## üìù Documentation Guidelines

### Be Accurate
- Document what you observe, not what you remember
- Test your observations multiple times
- Note when something is uncertain or needs verification

### Be Specific
- Include numbers, timings, and measurements when possible
- Describe exact button inputs and sequences
- Reference specific scenarios or situations

### Be Clear
- Write for someone who has never played No Mercy
- Use consistent terminology
- Define terms when first introduced

### Be Organized
- Use clear headings and structure
- Break complex systems into subsections
- Link to related documentation

### Cite Your Sources
- Reference video timestamps if applicable
- Link to screenshots in `/research/screenshots/`
- Credit community members who discovered information

---

## üö´ What Not to Include

### No Copyrighted Content
- ‚ùå Character names, likenesses, or stats from WWE/WWF
- ‚ùå Real wrestler names or branding
- ‚ùå Copyrighted logos, music, or assets
- ‚ùå Screenshots containing copyrighted imagery (real wrestlers, logos)

### What You CAN Include
- ‚úÖ Descriptions of game mechanics
- ‚úÖ Technical measurements and timing data
- ‚úÖ System behavior documentation
- ‚úÖ Environmental measurements
- ‚úÖ Screenshots of menus, HUD, ring elements (no real wrestlers visible)

**When in doubt, ask!** Open an issue if you're unsure whether something is appropriate.
